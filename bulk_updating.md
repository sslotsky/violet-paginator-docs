# Bulk Updating

In addition to allowing for [inline updating](updating_items.md), `violet-paginator` also exposes functions that can update every item within the list. This might be handy when implementing something like an inbox where you want to mark all messages as `read` or `important`. As with single item updating, bulk updating has both an immediate and an asynchronous version.
